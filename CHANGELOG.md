## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Elixir** import graph (#72). `alias`, `import`, `require` and `use` resolve to the file that defines the module: nested `defmodule`s take their enclosing module as a prefix, `alias Foo.{A, Deep.B}` (even across lines) and `__MODULE__` expand, and anything inside a `"""` docstring or a comment is ignored. `mix.exs` dependencies become external nodes only when a module of that name is imported (`Phoenix.PubSub` finds `:phoenix_pubsub` by the whole atom, never by a prefix); the standard library, ExUnit, Mix and namespaces that no file defines are dropped. The OTP application and escript module named in `mix.exs`, and `use Mix.Task` modules, are entry points. The validator now accepts `alias` as import evidence (found on real code: it warned on every Elixir edge). Verified against phoenixframework/phoenix (206 Elixir files) and hexpm/hexpm (970 files, 63 edges, the OTP application detected, `ecto`/`phoenix`/`oban`/`plug` externals, 0 validation warnings).
- **Viewer: a "↻ Loops" toggle (#69).** Outlines every component and import that is part of a circular dependency on the main diagram, using the same data as the "Circular dependencies" tour. It is hidden when there are no loops, off by default, remembered per viewer, and follows into SVG/PNG/PDF export. Loops do not rely on colour: a dash-dot outline (distinct from every diff pattern), a heavier line and a ↻ mark in the component's label, in one violet that keeps 3:1 contrast on every surface in both themes. Covered by source-level accessibility tests and a real-browser check (`e2e/loops.e2e.mjs`) of the toggle, its state, persistence across reload, and the exported SVG.
- **Tour: "Possibly unused" (#71).** Components that no other component imports, largest first, each pointing at its own file. It is a hint and says so: dynamic loading, scripts and public API files are legitimately unreferenced. It never names entry points, tests, config, type declarations (`.d.ts`) or conventional build and task scripts (`setup.py`, `vite.config.js` and similar), needs at least three imports in the graph, and stays silent when more than 40% of components would qualify, since then the import graph is not telling you anything. Checked on real repositories: none for commander, express and this project; psf/requests lists `help.py`, which really is a `python -m requests.help` utility, so the wording stays a hint.
- **Circular dependencies: `require()` inside a function is lazy (#70).** A CommonJS `require` in a function body, getter or method runs on call, so it no longer counts toward a loop; one at module level, or inside a top-level `if`/`try`, still does. The function-body finder skips strings, template literals and comments, and anything it cannot classify counts as load-time, so the worst case is a loop that is still reported. When the components are folders, the overview now says that a loop between folders can still be a straight line between individual files (found while checking mochajs/mocha).
- **Circular dependencies.** A "Circular dependencies" tour appears whenever components import each other in a loop, directly or through a chain: an overview, then one real loop per group (largest first) with the import line that closes it as evidence. Groups are found with an iterative Tarjan pass over the import edges, so a 20,000-deep ring cannot overflow the stack, and nothing is drawn when there are no loops. Imports that do not run at load time never count: TypeScript `import type`, dynamic `import()`, Python imports under `if TYPE_CHECKING:` (any alias, e.g. `t.TYPE_CHECKING`) and Python imports inside a function body. Components that share a label inside one loop are numbered. Verified against real repositories: pallets/flask, psf/requests and encode/httpx report none (their only apparent loops are typing-only or lazy), pallets/click reports one genuine Windows-branch loop between `_compat.py` and `_winconsole.py`.

### Fixed
- **Python:** an import written inside a docstring or other triple-quoted string (for example `from flask import Flask` in an example) was counted as a real dependency, adding false edges to the graph. It is now ignored.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-10-02

### Changed
- **Performance: the file tree is processed off the main thread (#51).** Parsing the tree response, sorting it, applying `.gitignore`, and choosing manifests, view files and source files (`readTree` / `planSources` in the new `web/tree-plan.mjs`) now run in the same analysis Web Worker as the scan, through one shared worker per analysis (`createRunner`). It falls back to the calling thread if the worker cannot load, and cancelling rejects every pending job and terminates the worker. `makeView` also stopped rebuilding every ancestor directory string for every path. Measured in headless Chrome with a fake GitHub holding 7,245 files (`e2e/longtask.e2e.mjs`, a `longtask` observer, 4x CPU throttle on the development machine): the worst main-thread task between pressing Go and the results view went from 90-123 ms (two long tasks) to about 60 ms (one); the test now normalises for the speed of the machine it runs on. The test now fails above 100 ms.

### Added
- **Request tracing: GraphQL operations to resolvers (#56).** A client operation (`query` / `mutation` in a `.graphql` / `.gql` file, or in a `gql` / `graphql` template literal) is linked to the file that implements the root field it asks for, as an `http` edge such as `query users`, with a line on every side: where the operation is written, the schema field it resolves against, and the resolver key. The *exact only* rule is kept by construction: the schema field must be defined exactly once (a duplicate through `extend type` stays unlinked), the resolver must be a literal key of an assigned / exported / `resolvers:` object (spreads and computed keys are not read, and two files implementing the same field link to neither), aliases resolve to the real field, and fragment spreads and nested selections are never taken for root fields. Root types follow a `schema { query: ... }` rename. The website loader downloads the `.graphql` / `.gql` documents. Design notes are in `core/graphql-core.mjs`.
- **VS Code: "where am I?" and publishing (#57).** New command *Show this file in the architecture tour* (editor context menu, `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+G`) finds the component containing the active file from each component's sources (the line range that holds the cursor, then a source naming the file, then the enclosing folder; never a guess) and selects it in the tour panel, through a new `gvSelect` viewer message and a `ready` message the page sends once it is listening. Publication is prepared: a generated Marketplace icon (`scripts/make-icon.mjs`), complete package metadata, `.vscodeignore`, `npm run package`, and `.github/workflows/vscode-extension.yml`, which builds the `.vsix` on pull requests and, on a `vscode-v<version>` tag, attaches it to a GitHub release and publishes to the Visual Studio Marketplace and Open VSX when the `VSCE_PAT` / `OVSX_PAT` repository secrets exist (documented in the extension README, never printed).
- **Viewer: minimap (#52).** A small overview in the bottom-right corner of the diagram shows every component, the visible region as a rectangle, and moves the camera on click or drag. It appears only when part of the diagram is off screen, follows pan, zoom, "Zoom to step" and collapsed lanes (a collapsed lane is its one chip), is `aria-hidden` with no tab stops, is hidden on small screens, and is covered by a new browser smoke test (`e2e/minimap.e2e.mjs`).
- **Diff: moved files (#53).** A component whose file only changed directory (same name, size and description, and exactly one such file on each side, or the same id) is one `moved` component with `movedFrom` and its relationships kept, instead of a removal plus an addition. Edited, ambiguous and look-alike files stay add + remove. New state in the schema, validator, viewer legend (with its own dash pattern and a colour-blind-safe colour), CLI summary and pull request comment.
- **Infrastructure: Kubernetes manifests (#54).** Deployments, StatefulSets and DaemonSets, the Services that select them (every `selector` key must equal a pod label in the same namespace; an empty or unmatched selector links to nothing) and the Ingress rules that route to those Services, from any YAML file with `apiVersion` and `kind`, several documents per file. `yaml-lite` gained `parseYamlDocs` for multi-document files. Helm templates are skipped. The website loader downloads likely manifests (conventional folders first).
- **Infrastructure: Terraform resources (#55).** `resource` blocks (type, name, line range) and `type.name` references between them, read by a small dependency-free HCL scanner that ignores comments, string braces and heredocs. References to resources that do not exist, and `data.` / `var.` / `local.` / `module.` expressions, are dropped. Also downloaded by the website loader.
- **Request tracing: OpenAPI / Swagger documents.** `paths` in an `openapi.json`/`.yaml` or `swagger.json`/`.yaml` document become routes, with the line of each operation (YAML via the existing line-tracking reader, JSON via a positional scan), and link to client calls through the same matcher routes already use. The document itself becomes a lightweight diagram node so an HTTP edge has something real to point at. A malformed document yields no routes rather than throwing; a path never called by any client adds no edge. Also joins the website's view-file download guarantee (#50).
- **Data model: Django models.** Classes deriving `models.Model` and their `ForeignKey` / `OneToOneField` / `ManyToManyField` targets (a bare class, a quoted `"app.Model"` reference, or `"self"`, which is correctly excluded as a self-relation) join the existing SQL and Prisma data-model view, with the same file-and-line evidence. A relation to a name that isn't actually a model (a plain class, a typo) is dropped, never guessed. `models.py` is now also in the website's view-file download list, so a large repository's file budget can't silently drop it. Verified against a real Django library, pennersr/django-allauth: 11 models, 4 relations, clean validation (#49).
- **Viewer:** "Print / save as PDF" (a "PDF" toolbar button). Builds a standalone document — the overview, then one page per step with that step's own highlighted diagram (from the same export the SVG/PNG buttons use), its narration and its source links — forced to light-on-white regardless of the current theme, and opens it in a new tab for the browser's own print dialog. Works inside the website's sandboxed tour frame too, since it opens a new (unsandboxed) tab rather than calling `window.print()` on the current document. Verified end to end with a real headless-Chrome print of this project's own self-tour (#46).
- **Scala** import graph, sharing the JVM class index with Java and Kotlin: plain, braced (`{A, B => C}`) and wildcard (`_`/Scala 3 `*`) imports resolve to Scala, Kotlin or Java files; `build.sbt` dependencies become external nodes only when actually imported; `object X extends App` and `def main` are entry points. Verified against a real, large codebase (typelevel/cats-effect, 465 Scala files) — which also caught and fixed a real bug where a license header (`/* ... */` block comment) before the `package` clause silently hid it, dropping nearly every import in the file to unresolved (#48).
- **Swift** import graph: `import Module` resolves to a Swift Package Manager target (`Sources/<Target>/`) declared in `Package.swift`; a product dependency (`.product(name:, package:)`) becomes an external node, and system frameworks or anything undeclared are dropped rather than guessed. `main.swift` and `@main` are recognised as entry points. Verified against apple/swift-algorithms (#47).
- **Website:** a motion layer (`site/motion.js`) built on GSAP, ScrollTrigger, anime.js and three.js — a cursor-reactive node-graph canvas fixed behind the whole page (not just the hero), with its depth and intensity tied to scroll position, a character-split headline entrance, scroll-triggered reveals for every section, 3D tilt on cards, a cursor spotlight and a trailing ring cursor, an infinite language marquee, a scroll-progress bar, a scroll-linked progress line under "How it works", drifting gradient blobs behind the CTA, a typewriter-cycling search placeholder, a decrypt/scramble-in effect on section kickers, magnetic/ripple buttons, and a live GitHub star count. All of it loads from a CDN as an optional enhancement: with no network, no WebGL, or `prefers-reduced-motion`, the page is exactly the static layout it was before.
- **CLI:** `gitvisualise init [repo]` sets a repository up in one command — generates the tour, writes `.github/workflows/architecture.yml` (only if it does not already exist, matching the publishing guide's snippet exactly), and prints the README badge Markdown, detecting the repository from a GitHub URL, `--repo-url`, or the local `origin` remote. Idempotent, and `--dry-run` shows what it would do without writing anything (#42).
- **Website:** the gallery moved from static HTML into `site/gallery.json`, rendered by `app.js` — adding a repository needs no HTML edit, just a data entry and a screenshot. `test/gallery.test.mjs` rejects a malformed `owner/repo`, a duplicate, a missing `lang`/`desc`, or a missing screenshot before it can ship. Documented in CONTRIBUTING.md (#43).
- **Viewer:** a colour-blind-safe palette option (a "Colours" toolbar button, remembered per viewer) that switches component kinds and the added/removed/changed diff states to the Okabe-Ito categorical palette. Diff states also get their own dash pattern now (solid / dotted / dashed) regardless of palette, and the legend swatch carries the same +/−/~ mark already used on nodes, so they read in greyscale too. Exports follow whichever palette is active, since the SVG/PNG export already inlines each element's live computed style (#45).
- **Viewer:** a "?" keyboard shortcuts dialog (also the "Keys" toolbar button) listing every shortcut, closable with Esc or the backdrop, that returns focus to wherever it was opened from. The list is generated from one array in `viewer.js` that a new test (`test/shortcuts.test.mjs`) checks against the literal keys the handlers actually check, so a shortcut can't be added or changed without the dialog following. Works in the standalone page, the website's tour frame and the VS Code webview alike, since all three share the same viewer bundle (#44).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added
- **Kotlin** import graph (class, wildcard and aliased imports, `fun main` entry points), the project's first community contribution (#20, thanks @Voyagerroc-Lab).
- **Languages:** C#, Ruby, PHP, C/C++ and Dart import graphs. Each resolves only to files that exist, and reports a third-party package only when a
  manifest (`.csproj`, `Gemfile` / gemspec, `composer.json`, `pubspec.yaml`) declares it.
- **Export:** `gitvisualise export --format mermaid|plantuml`, and Copy as Mermaid / PlantUML / README badge in the website's new Export menu.
- **Request tracing:** calls made through a client with a literal `baseURL` / `prefixUrl` (`axios.create`, `ky.extend`, `axios.defaults.baseURL`) in the same file are linked to their routes.
- **GitHub Action:** `comment-diff: true` posts one pull request comment summarising how the architecture changed (off by default).
- **Tests:** a real-browser smoke test (`npm run e2e`) that pastes a repository into the website and checks the tour is on screen, with its own CI job.
- **Website:** the analysis (scan, generate, validate) runs in a Web Worker, so large repositories no longer freeze the page; it falls back to the main thread where workers are unavailable, and Cancel terminates it.
- **Infrastructure and data-model views:** Docker Compose services (dependencies, start order, and the code each is built from) and SQL / Prisma tables with foreign keys, each with the file and lines it came from, and a tour for each. Works in the CLI and on the website.
- **VS Code extension** (0.1, in `vscode-extension/`): open the tour beside your code and jump from any component to its file and line. Analyses locally, writes nothing into the workspace, and treats the webview as untrusted.
- **Optional AI narration** (website, off by default): with your own API key a language model rewrites the plain step narration. Only structured facts are sent (never source code), what is sent is previewed in the dialog, nothing happens until you confirm, output is checked to mention only components in the tour and must pass validation, and rewritten steps are labelled. Tested against a fake provider only.
- **CLI:** `gitvisualise watch` rebuilds the tour on every change (and on hand edits of `architecture.json`).
- **Website:** a redesigned landing page with a gallery of real tours, a feature grid and a contributor call to action.
- **Viewer:** swimlanes can be collapsed into a single chip and expanded again (per lane or all at once), keyboard-operable, with playback highlighting the chip and selection or search opening the lane.
- **Viewer:** screen reader announcements, keyboard navigation between connected components, a skip link and forced-colors support.
- **Docs:** a guide to publishing your own tour, a public roadmap, and a language plug-in contract for contributors.

### Changed
- Languages are now plug-ins registered in `core/languages.mjs`; behaviour for existing languages is unchanged.
- The validator no longer mistakes a package name that ends like a file (`Newtonsoft.Json`) for a missing file.

### Fixed
- The Java resolver no longer crashes on an import that did not come from its own parser.
- `gitvisualise watch` no longer mistakes its own output for a hand edit when it has to poll (Node 18 on Linux).
- Cached tours are versioned, so tours analysed before the new languages and views are refreshed instead of shown stale.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-19

### Added
- **Languages:** Java (packages, classes, static and wildcard imports, Maven and Gradle dependencies, Spring Boot entry points) and
  Rust (`mod` and `use` resolution, workspaces, `Cargo.toml`) import graphs; Go workspaces (`go.work`).
- **Aliases:** `tsconfig`/`jsconfig` `paths`, `baseUrl` and `extends`, and simple Vite and webpack aliases, resolved to real files.
- **Monorepos:** one component per workspace package (npm, pnpm, Cargo, `go.work`), and analysis of a single folder with
  `--path <dir>`, `owner/repo:folder` or a `/tree/<ref>/<folder>` link.
- **Request tracing:** client `fetch`/`axios`/`$http`/`ky`/`got` calls are linked to the server routes that handle them (exact method and
  path-segment match, Express router mounts and Flask `methods` resolved), as `http` edges with evidence on both sides and a
  "Request: METHOD /path" tour.
- **Architecture diff:** `owner/repo@base...head` (and `gitvisualise diff <older> <newer>`) marks components and relationships added,
  removed or changed, with a generated "What changed" tour. Removed items carry evidence pinned to the older commit.
- **Viewer:** light / dark / auto theme, component search (`/`), export as SVG or PNG, swimlanes by group, directory or kind, and deep
  links to any tour step.
- **Website:** paginated repository picker, IndexedDB cache keyed by commit (private repositories only if opted in), theme
  sync, shareable step links, monorepo package chips, a "Compare..." button and optional "Sign in with GitHub" (off by default,
  see `server/github-oauth`).
- **Docs:** screenshots and an animated walkthrough in the README.

### Changed
- Cached tours are versioned, so a release that changes generator output never shows stale results.
- Python imports follow Python 3 semantics: a bare `import b` inside a package no longer resolves to a sibling module.
- The project name comes from the shallowest manifest, not the first nested package.

### Fixed
- Java packages named `samples` or `demo` under `src/main/java` are no longer mistaken for an examples folder.
- Go `require` lines and Rust `mod x;` declarations no longer produce validator warnings.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed
- **Website:** the tour could appear blank after analysing a repository, leaving only the toolbar. The sandboxed
  frame is now created fresh for every tour, inside the already visible results view.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-19

First public release.

### Added
- **Website**: paste a GitHub link or pick a repository from an account, and get an interactive, narrated architecture
  tour generated entirely in the browser, with no backend. Supports deep links (`#/owner/repo`), optional tokens for
  private repositories, downloadable output, and a sandboxed player.
- **Command line** (`gitvisualise`): `scan`, `generate`, `validate`, `build`, `all`, `serve` and `install-skill`, for
  local folders and GitHub URLs. Zero dependencies.
- **Claude Code skill** (`repo-architecture`) that inspects a repository, writes grounded architecture data and
  narration, validates it, and preserves manual edits.
- **GitHub Action** that regenerates the tour in any repository's workflow.
- **Scanner** with import graphs for JavaScript/TypeScript (including JSX, Vue, Svelte), Python and Go, plus entry
  point, route and dependency detection.
- **Validator** that rejects nonexistent files, out-of-range line numbers, dangling references and invented paths in
  narration.
- **Merge** that keeps curated (`claude`, `manual`, `locked`) items across regenerations.
- **Viewer** with play, pause, step and restart controls, speed control, voice narration, a "zoom to step" camera,
  keyboard shortcuts, dark mode, a phone layout, reduced-motion support and a no-JavaScript fallback.
- A self-documenting architecture tour of this repository in `docs/architecture/`.
